<h1>TrueCraft</h1>
<p>The good old days of Minecraft, brought back in all their simplistic glory.</p>
<h2>About TrueCraft</h2>
<p>A completely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design">clean-room</a>
implementation of Minecraft beta 1.7.3 (circa September 2011). No decompiled
code has been used in the development of this software.</p>
<p>I miss the old days of Minecraft, when it was a simple game. It was nearly
perfect. Most of what Mojang has added since beta 1.7.3 is fluff, life support
for a game that was "done" years ago. This is my attempt to get back to the
original spirit of Minecraft, before there were things like the End, or
all-in-one redstone devices, or village gift shops. A simple sandbox where you
can build and explore and fight with your friends. I miss that.</p>

<p>Some of these screenshots are of the official Minecraft client connecting to a
TrueCraft server, and some are of the TrueCraft client connecting to a TrueCraft
server. You can tell the difference by the texture packs - the official assets
are screenshots of the official Minecraft client.</p>

<p><p>Spent the past couple of days working on server performance and stability improvements. In
particular, common deadlocks have been fixed, chunk loading performance has been
improved, and many tasks were adjusted to more intelligently use the thread pool and divide
work between the main thread and thread pool (without breaking things).</p> <a href="/blog/40/Performance%20%26%20stability%20improvements">Read more »</a></p>

<p><p>Today I hopped back into TrueCraft dev for a little while to deal with some issues concerning
the physics engine. There were some cases where you could walk into corners and end up not
triggering a collision, which would lead to the player being flung high up into the air once they
were detected to be inside of a block on the next tick.</p> <a href="/blog/38/Improvements%20to%20physics%20engine">Read more »</a></p>

<p><p>I didn't plan on working on TrueCraft today, but I got on Twitch.tv to stream and one thing led to
another. I have implemented the day/night cycle in the client, though it's still a little bit buggy. The
sun and moon textures now included by default with TrueCraft are courtesey of the
<a href="http://www.minecrafttexturepacks.com/isabella/">Isabella pack</a>, which is CC-BY-SA, since our
current texture pack didn't actually override the sun/moon textures from Minecraft.</p> <a href="/blog/37/Rendering%20the%20day/night%20cycle%20lighting%20in%20the%20client">Read more »</a></p>

<p><p>Today I spent some time on Twitch streaming some TrueCraft work, and I finished up the lighting
improvements started by mrpimpunicorn in the client. I fixed a few issues with things like snow,
which you may have noticed had horribly broken lighting, and I fixed issues with the blocks that
were lit incorrectly at chunk boundaries.</p> <a href="/blog/36/Improvements%20to%20client%20side%20lighting%20and%20performance">Read more »</a></p>
