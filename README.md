# TrueCraft

An open-source implementation of Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 (July 2011).

## What is TrueCraft

This is a completely
[clean-room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) implementation of
Minecraft as it appeared in July of 2011. Contributors must verify that they
have never read any decompiled Minecraft code before submitting their changes
upstream.

## Why make it?

(begin opinionated section)

Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 was the perfect version of Minecraft. Most of what Mojang
added afterwards was fluff and, collectively, ruined the game. The goal of this
project is to take that perfect version and bring it back to life by effectively
forking Minecraft. We want the old spirit of Minecraft back, but actively
maintained and with a community that once again may thrive.

(end opinionated section)

I got tired of maintaining Craft.Net. I never had time to add features, I was
just keeping up the latest updates from Mojang to a game I liked less and less.
This project sets the goal in stone - implement Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. It's not a
moving target and I don't dislike that version of the game.

## Status

This project is very early in development, so don't expect to gain much from it.
The server will come first, and then the client. After then, some of the good
features from future versions of Minecraft will be implemented (like creative
mode, sprinting, etc).

Note that large-scale refactorings are probably going to be common for a while.
Minecraft is not very well designed and it's TrueCraft's responsibility to hide
this behind nicer abstractions.

## Community

There isn't much of one yet, but this is a sort of spiritual successor to
Craft.Net. The folks in #craft.net on Freenode will probably talk to you about
this project if you ask nicely.

## Blah blah blah

TrueCraft is not associated with Mojang or Minecraft in any sort of official
capacity.
